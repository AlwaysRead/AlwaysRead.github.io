Welcome to my personal blog, where I'll pretend I know what I'm doing while simultaneously Googling "how to write a blog post" in another tab.

I'm Chinmoy Saikia, currently a 3rd-year Computer Science student at JSS Academy of Technical Education, Bangalore, who finally decided to stop *just thinking* about blogging and actually start one. I'm currently in that delightful phase of "figuring out life choices and future goals" while pretending I have it all together. This decision ranks somewhere between "managing Python conflicted packages" (of course it's Machine Learning) and "trying to understand and solve Leetcode Questions" on my list of questionable life choices.

I have absolutely zero blogging experience — so if this post feels like a monologue from a lost coder wandering through the digital wilderness with nothing but semicolons and false confidence, well... you're getting the authentic experience.

## What to Expect

This blog is my little corner of the internet where I'll be sharing:

- What I'm learning (mostly by breaking things first)
- What I'm building (and the 47 Stack Overflow tabs that made it possible)
- What I'm occasionally breaking (spoiler: it's usually everything)
- Random thoughts that pop up during late-night debugging sessions (like "why did I choose this major?" and "is cereal soup?")

Whether you're here for tech insights, personal reflections of a caffeinated college student, or just to watch someone publicly document their slow descent into dependency on energy drinks and syntax highlighters — I'm genuinely glad to have you here.

## Final Thoughts

Fair warning: I can't promise consistency, but I can promise authenticity. And by authenticity, I mean you'll probably witness me celebrate fixing a bug that I created in the first place.

Stay connected, keep exploring, and remember — we're all just winging it with varying degrees of confidence!
