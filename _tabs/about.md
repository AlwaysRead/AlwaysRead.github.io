Hi there! I'm **Chinmoy Saikia**, and welcome to my corner of the digital world! I'm passionate about technology, continuous learning, and sharing knowledge with the community.

## Who I Am

I'm a Computer Science Engineering student (3rd year) pursuing from JSSATE Bengaluru with a growing passion for DevOps, cloud technologies, and machine learning. When I'm not attending lectures or working on assignments, you can find me experimenting with new cloud services, building ML projects, or setting up CI/CD pipelines. I believe in learning by doing and sharing knowledge with the community as I grow in my tech journey.

## What I Do

- **Development**: Building projects with Python, Java, and web technologies while strengthening my programming fundamentals
- **DevOps & Cloud**: Learning infrastructure automation, containerization, and cloud deployment practices
- **Machine Learning**: Experimenting with ML algorithms, working on personal projects, and understanding real-world applications
- **Learning**: Currently diving deeper into Kubernetes, advanced ML techniques, and cloud architecture patterns
- **Sharing**: Documenting my learning journey, project experiences, and the challenges I overcome as a student

## My Journey

My journey in Computer Science began with curiosity about how technology shapes our world. As a 3rd-year CSE student, I've discovered my passion lies at the intersection of development, operations, and intelligent systems. Through coursework, personal projects, and hands-on experimentation, I've gained experience in cloud platforms, DevOps practices, and machine learning fundamentals. Each project teaches me something new and motivates me to explore deeper into these exciting fields.

## Skills & Interests

**Technical Skills:**
- Programming Languages: Python, Java, JavaScript, C++, SQL
- Cloud Platforms: AWS Services, Google Cloud, Microsoft Azure
- DevOps Tools: Docker, Git/GitHub, Jenkins, basic Kubernetes
- ML/AI: Scikit-learn, TensorFlow basics, Pandas, NumPy, Jupyter Notebooks
- Databases: MySQL, MongoDB basics, PostgreSQL
- Web Technologies: HTML, CSS, React basics
- Areas of Focus: DevOps Automation, Cloud Computing, Machine Learning Applications

**Beyond Code:**
- Open Source - Contributing to projects and learning from the community
- Problem Solving - Participating in coding challenges and hackathons
- Continuous Learning - Following tech trends and taking online courses
- Academic Projects - Applying classroom knowledge to real-world problems

## Why I Write

This blog serves as my learning journal where I document my journey as a CSE student, share project experiences, and write about the technologies I'm exploring. Whether it's a DevOps pipeline I've set up, a machine learning model I've trained, or a cloud service I've experimented with, I hope my experiences can help fellow students and aspiring developers.
